Objectives outline will always be visible regardless of the distance and also will be color coded!

Not just the objectives that will get outlined but these as well:
- Required Objectives (Yellow)
- Optional Objectives (White)
- Escape Vehicle (Green)
- Robots (Red)

Enabling outlines can make the game easier if you want it to be more challenging. Each type of outline can be turned off individually in the options.
