[b]Objectives outline will always be visible regardless of the distance and also will be color coded![/b]

Not just the objectives that will get outlined but these as well:
[list]
[*] Required Objectives (Yellow)
[*] Optional Objectives (White)
[*] Escape Vehicle (Green)
[*] Robots (Red - [i]if the robots are also the objectives the yellow/white outline will takes precedence over this one[/i])
[/list]

Enabling outlines can make the game easier if you want it to be more challenging - each type of outline can be turned off individually in the options.

Known issues:
[list]
[*] When getting close to the objectives, the custom outline will get overridden by the default one (lower opacity white outline that fades out relative to the distance)
